- https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/, provided info for how to actually upload stuff to GitHub! Which I haven't done before

- Data Wrangling Case Study/Data Wrangling lessons were referred back to a great deal for reminders on how to interact with the OSM data, and how to programmatically audit then clean it

- Many forum posts provided assistance on auditing techniques, and helped me wrap my head around how to start and structure the initially overwhelming project

- https://developers.google.com/edu/python/regular-expressions, provided a more readable understanding of how to use regular expressions for me than the official python documentation
